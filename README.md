Our Tunisian cuisine represents a unique culinary experience since it’s a mixture
of spicy, tasty and original mixture of ingredients. Whoever tries the Tunisian
cuisine gets immediately attached to its flavorfulness and Succulence.
However, Despite the rich and diverse history of Tunisian cuisine, many people
around the world, particularly non-Arab individuals, are not fully aware of the
unique traditional dishes that Tunisia has to offer. This lack of awareness is
because there isn’t enough resources and references that showcase the depth and
variety of our centuries-old gastronomy. Normally global culinary trends and
shows often spotlight more widely known cuisines, and ours Tunisian relatively
underrepresented.
This project aims to fill this gap by providing an accessible, user-friendly
platform that highlights the flavors, ingredients, and cooking techniques that
define Tunisian cuisine. It also aims to make people who are not familiar with it,
experience our unique roots that are a blend of Mediterranean, Arab, and
African influences.
The website will serve a bunch of functionalites for users to explore traditional
Tunisian recipes fully, with an emphasis on ease of use, accessibility, and
engagement. The platform will include recipes going from appetizers, main
course to deserts. Along with these recipes users will get more attached by
reading personal and heartfelt stories shared about it. Finally, they’ll have a free
space to share funny, lighthearted confessions about beginner mistakes, innocent
pranks etc..
All of this will be managed by an admin to make sure the content shared on the
website is community friendly and serves for the purpose of our project.
Throughout our endeavor, there will be a development of both the front-end and
back-end components of the website, utilizing modern web service technologies
to create an interactive and user-friendly experience.
